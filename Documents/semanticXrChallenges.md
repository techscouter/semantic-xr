# Semantic-XR Related Challenges

Semantic-XR is still a **work in progress technology** and comes with several challenges and as such also potential challenges that are yet to be identified.

## Example challenges and potential solutions
* Impact of generating the semantic data on **performance**.
  * But this potential issue could be mitigated by measures such as...
    * Support for only high semantic level of detail (only higher level objects by default, not all).
    * Using a schemaVersion with a more limited scope.
    * Lower spatial resolution (for example for images).
    * Lower temporal resolution (frequency of updates).
    * Use more capable and powerful hardware.
* Potential **abuse in competitive games**.
  * But...
    * A lot of non competitive use cases of XR exist. For example, education, social VR, training, entertainment, healthcare, fitness, meditation, data visualization, enterprise, non-competitive games etc. There are also a lot of use cases for generic 3D\ 4D media like videos, movies, TV, animation, 3D modeling, CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and much more…
    * Another important use case is using Semantic-XR based Accessibility Solutions within a game engine or an editor software during the authoring stage of XR Experiences (even competitive games) and other 3D\ 4D media. This would be an inclusive solution to enable people with disabilities to participate in the authoring of such content.
    * Creative Mode or Tutorial Mode in competitive games could still benefit from externalizing Semantic-XR and leveraging existing Accessibility Solutions.
    * Slightly changing the exported Semantic-XR data like only approximations of locations etc.
    * Partial sharing of data using a schemaVersion with a limited scope to avoid competitive advantages.
    * Internal-use only of generated Semantic-XR by the creator can be done without export at all of Semantic-XR data. This could be achieved using one-off Accessibility Solutions tailored for the specific experience or using internal reusable plugins (from the creator’s studio) or 3rd party reusable plugins (from the open source community or from marketplaces).
    * Existing measures of battling abuse.
* **People with disabilities participation**.
  * But...
    * Frequent, early and thorough testing and participation in solution design by people with disabilities.
* **Creators of XR Experiences and Accessibility Solution providers and Assistive Technology makers including developers with disabilities participation.**
  * But...
    * Frequent, early and thorough participation in designing and testing the solution by content creators and accessibility solution providers including people with disabilities.
* Potential **security** issues for consumers of semantic data from unverified sources. 
  * But...
    * Further research into using digital signatures and checksums might be useful to enable verification of the source and integrity of the Semantic-XR data. 
* Potential **privacy** issues (for example if players' details are provided as part of the semantic data without consent and\ or in violation of privacy regulations).
  * But...
    * Transparency.
    * Opt-in consent.
    * Partial sharing of data using a schemaVersion with a limited scope and\ or using filters of private data.
* There are **accessibility categories that would be difficult to support** by relying only on the semantic format. For example: content related (such as puzzle hints) and deep modifications (such as avoiding shaky camera movements).
  * But...
    * Not all accessibility challenges could be addressed by Semantic-XR based solutions.
* Wide agreement on common guiding principles, the format itself, the schemaVersions etc.
  * But…
    * A large group effort.
    * Formal standardization by a standards organization.
