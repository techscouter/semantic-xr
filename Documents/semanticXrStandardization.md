# Semantic-XR Standardization

This page describes how the Semantic-XR format could be used in the future as part of the standardization of XR Accessibility ("XR" in the broad sense of **any** 3D or 4D media). It describes a way to define conformance levels, similar to the W3C WCAG’s A, AA and AAA conformance levels.

## Standardization: XR Accessibility Conformance Levels
`schemaVersion` is an important field of the Semantic-XR format. Below is an explanation of this field as well as a description of how it could be used to enable the definition of XR Accessibility Conformance Levels.

A specific Semantic-XR document’s schemaVersion field value describes which Semantic-XR fields are mandatory and must be included in this specific Semantic-XR document and which fields are optional. schemaVersion field’s value is not strictly a semantic versioning string but it could be a string that can describe combinations of mandatory and optional sets of fields (for example: GlobalPositionsOnly_0.1.0 or BasicWithoutImages_0.0.1 etc.). schemaVersion values would probably include a namespace component to avoid naming collisions - this might be based on using a domain-like string structure. A Semantic-XR generator (like one in a video game or a movie player) can publish its supported schemaVersions to align expectations with its clients.

schemaVersion could also be used in the future for short codes to represent agreed upon conformance levels. In a similar manner to W3C WCAG’s A, AA and AAA conformance levels for web content - a W3C XCAG (XR Content Accessibility Guidelines) standard could be defined. The new standard could include WCAG-like conformance levels based on the Semantic-XR’s schemaVersion values. For example A, AA or AAA schemaVersion field values would specify different lists of mandatory fields that should appear in the Semantic-XR metadata that would in turn enable different types and levels of Accessibility Solutions supporting multiple disabilities.
